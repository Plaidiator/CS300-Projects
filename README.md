# CS300-Projects

In these projects, I tested different storage systems and chose one to use for a final project. These data structures were primarily tested on their run-time efficiency and compatibility with the data given. In project 1, I go over my testing and thought process which led me to using a hash table in project two. The main roadblock I faced was memory access faults in C++. Solving these issues has greatly improved my understanding of C++ and memory management. While I adjusted pointers and other code, I made sure to factor my program in a way that was simpler to read so I would know where I had already made changes and where I ahdn't check yet. Doing this has helped me understand how I should write code from the beginning so that it is easier to make adjustments later.
